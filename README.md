# Covid-19-India-Data-Analysis
This ccode basically plots the graphs of covid 19 for India analysis in 3 parts.\n
1)Ovberall analysis countrywise\n
2)Statewise analtsis of active cases\n
3)Combined comparison of states and UT's\n
This comparison just gelps us visualise which state is doing better \abnd which one needs to improve. Because raw data
can sometimes be misleading because all states do not have same populaton, In fact some states have very high population
comparatively cases, vice versa. So I hace also taken into account the population in the last section .
